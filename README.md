# Mysql-Project_1
The project aim was to extract relevant data from the dataset representing a social media platform.


Concepts like Aggregate functions, Group By, Temporary Tables, Views, and Stored Procedures  were used to fetch required results.
The Instagram Clone data set was transferred to MySQL using the Import Wizard.
The dataset was used to extract information of users such as the user who got the most likes on a post, users who never commented or posted, the most used tag.
